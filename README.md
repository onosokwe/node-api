# node-api

In this program, I demonstrated how some Node modules works, basically:

### Events module, 
### Filesystem module
### Http module
### Readline module

Understanding how to use Nodejs http server and the Express framework to build REST APIs I believe should be preceded by a basic understanding of Node modules.

One of the best places to begin your learning of any language or framework or library is the official documentation.
